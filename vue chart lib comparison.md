## Result

I would suggest **Vue Flow** since it seems to be the most flexible option, and it is very well documented (guide,
examples, etc.). An alternative could
be Drawflow, but it looks like there are not as many options and flexibility. Also, the documentation of Drawflow does
not involve any guide. Diagram.js is more general and does not build upon vue. Features like import/export and editing
of attributes seem to be added externally.
